Hawtio Spring Boot Project

Welcome to the Hawtio Spring Boot Project! This project integrates the Hawtio management console with a Spring Boot application for monitoring and management.

Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/radlee/hawt_spring_io.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd hawt_spring_io

Run the Application

Use Maven to start the Spring Boot application:

mvn spring-boot:run

Alternatively, you can package the application and run the JAR file:

Package the application:

mvn clean package

Run the JAR file:

java -jar target/hawt_spring_io.jar

Access Hawtio

Once the application starts, the Hawtio management console will be available at:

http://localhost:8080/hawtio

(Replace 8080 with the port specified in your Spring Boot application if itâ€™s different.)

Configuration

Disable Authentication (Optional)

For development purposes, you can disable authentication by adding the following to application.properties:

hawtio.authenticationEnabled=false

Enable Authentication (Recommended for Production)

Follow the steps to set up secure access as outlined in the project documentation.

Troubleshooting

Dependency Issues: Ensure all dependencies are properly installed by running:

mvn dependency:resolve

Port Conflicts: If the default port is in use, specify a different port in application.properties:

server.port=8081

"Host Not Allowlisted" Error: Add the required host to the allowlist in application.properties:

hawtio.proxyAllowlist=localhost,127.0.0.1,example.com
